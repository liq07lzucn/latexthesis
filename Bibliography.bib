abstract ={An approach to variable metric algorithms has been investigated in which the linear search sub-problem no longer becomes necessary. The property of quadratic termination has been replaced by one of monotonic convergence of the eigenvalues of the approximating matrix to the inverse hessian. A convex class of updating formulae which possess this property has been established, and a strategy has been indicated for choosing a member of the class so as to keep the approximation away from both singularity and unboundedness. A FORTRAN program has been tested extensively with encouraging results.},

	Abstract = {A Hessian update is described that preserves sparsity and positive definiteness and satisfies a minimal change property. The update reduces to the BFGS update in the dense case and generalises a recent result in [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 26 (1989), pp. 727-739] relating to the Byrd and Nocedal measure function. A surprising outcome is that a sparsity projection of the inverse Hessian plays a major role. It is shown that the Hessian itself can be recovered from this information under mild assumptions.  The update is computed by solving a concave programming problem derived by using the Wolfe
dual. The Hessian of the dual is important and plays a similar role to the matrix Q that arises in the sparse PSB update of Toint [Math. Comp., 31 (1977), pp. 954-961]. This matrix is shown to satisfy the same structural and definiteness conditions as Toint’s matrix. The update has been implemented for tridiagonal systems and some numerical experiments are described. These experiments indicate that there is potential for a significant reduction in the number of quasi-Newton iterations, but that more development is needed to obtain an efficient implementation. Solution of the variational problem by primal methods is also discussed and provides an interesting application of generalized elimination. The possibility of instability and nonexistence of a positive definite update raised by Sorensen [Math. Programming Study, 18 (1982), pp. 135-159] is still a difficulty and some remedies
are discussed.},
